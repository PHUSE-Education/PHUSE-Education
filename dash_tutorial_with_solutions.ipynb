    "## 1. Introduction to DASH\n",
    "`Dash` is an Open Source Framework for building reactive, web-based applications. It enabled you to create analytical dashboards with ``python``. These apps can be run in your local web-browser, on a server of your company or the internet, making it accessible to a large audience. If you're familiar with the statistical [programming language `R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) then you can think of DASH as the equivalent to the [RShiny framework](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) but this time for `python`. Dash is an open sourced and released under the permissive MIT license.\n",

    "Open your terminal (linux/ubuntu) or Anaconda prompt (Windows) and install Jupyter-Dash with the following commands. Use of a ``virtualenv`` environment is strongly recommended but not mandatory, you can also just use the base environment that comes with the installation of Anaconda. Read about creating and managing environments with conda here -> [docs.conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). \n",

    "The data which we will use is put online by the PSI Organisation within the [Wonderful Wednesdays Workshops](https://www.psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/visualisation/welcome-to-wonderful-wednesdays).

    "The background of the data set is Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Patients with CKD often suffer from symptoms of anaemia. Medical counter interventions aim to raise \n",
    "haemoglobin (Hgb) concentration in blood plasma. This data comes from a simulated trial of 300 CKD patients with two treatment arms (new experimental treatment (E) and current standard of care (C)). For each patient data is measured repeatedly from Baseline to Week 24 on a 4-weekly basis.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The primary objective is to demonstrate efficacy by achieving a mean Hgb within the target range of 10 â€“ 11.5 g/dL at week 24. Additionally patients benefit from reduced Hgb variability, and in an ideal case the treatment would produce a smooth increase in Hgb to the target range and keep stable Hgb levels there. \n",

    "If you look at the boxplots then several things catch the eye. First, we notice that the medians for treatment ``E`` are slightly above those for control. Secondly, the variability of the central 50% of the data points seems to be lower in the ``E`` group then in the ``C`` group, which can be deduced from the width of the boxes in the figure. Additionally, the tails for the Control group seem to be much longer then for the experimental treatment. So we can infer from the figures that treatment ``E`` supports a potential benefit of the experimental treatment over the control in terms of a lower variability and a higher stability of Hgb values across the visits. \n",

So we just go ahead and reference the ``component_id`` to the same ``id`` we provided to our ``dcc.Checklist``, namely ``checkbox-options``. Next, for the ``component_property`` fill in the name of the parameter in the dash layout component where the input values shall come from. In this case we simple tell it to take them from the value parameter in ``dcc.Checklist``. Now the callback knows which element in the layout to look at and what its input values are.\n",

We plug the ``component_id`` to the ``id='graph-output'`` of the layout component ``dcc.Graph`` and say that its property is ``figure``, because we want to render a graphic. Conveniently, our callback function ``update_my_boxplots`` returns a graphics-object, namely ``fig`` and this is channeled through the ``Output`` property to the ``figure`` parameter in ``dcc.Graph``, ultimately allowing for an update of the whole picture.\n",

    "1. Patients with anaemia need to achieve a target range of Hgb values between 10 and 11.5 g/dL. Let's add two lines for the range to our figure so we can better judge visually the proportions of patients who achieve that goal. You can go ahead and search your way through the web to find out on how to accomplish this in python or just use the hints below:\n",

Notice how the ``x1``-value is updated dynamically with the variable we created in 1.1.

This may substantiate the visual inference which was previously made with hard statistical measures. Now be assured, this is not an easy task if you're unfamiliar with plotly and python but it is achievable with some enthusiasm. Here are some hints to help you out:\n",

    "\n",
    "```dataframe_name.groupby([\"variable_name\", \"variable_name\"]).agg({\"numeric_variable\": \"statistical_function\"}) # calculate statistic ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to calculate the standard deviation in the same manner as the mean (above piece of code with agg{}), you need to define a separate function. \n",

    "# define sample standard deviation as a function of a variable\n",
    "def st_dev(x):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This time don't use quotation marks in the ```.agg({\"numeric_variable\": my_own_function})``` part. We need them only with inbuilt module functions like the ``mean`` in python.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need to store the x-axis values somewhere. This way you know where to put the text in the figure.\n",
    "For example, you can get the x-axis tick values with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```np.arange(0,len(dataframe_name[\"variable_name\"].unique()), 1)```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have two grouped boxplots at each x-axis tick, the above may need some adjustments, maybe two variables i.e. one for each treatment, one left and one right of the main tick values. \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    " * Once you have the x-values and the calculated y-values (means or standard deviations for each visit and treatment arm), you add the annotations with something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```  # loop through the xi, yi values and add them to the figure at the proper positions\n",
    "    for xi, yi in zip(xvalues, y_means):\n",
    "        fig.add_annotation(x=xi, y=20, text=yi, showarrow=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to create two loops, one for the means and one for the standard deviations.\n",
    "***\n",
    "Additional hints:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your dataframe with the calculated statistic (mean or standard deviation) needs to be sorted according to the order of the boxplots in the figure. If you don't do this, then the values will not correspond to the proper boxplot. To achieve this task, one could merge the numerical values (i.e. AVISITN, TRT01PN) from the original dataframe to the one with the statistical calculation. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
