# PHUSE-Education

**PHUSE** is a global community of Clinical Data Scientists.

The diverse membership mainly covers the Pharma & Healthcare Industry, CROs and software vendors at all levels of seniority.
We are more than ever competing with other industries especially in recruiting and retaining fresh data science talents.

**Education** has become a major challenge with our rapidly changing environment in regards to technology and methodology.

Our vision is to create a **PHUSE** roadmap to education, which covers the broad bandwidth of knowledge a Clinical Data Scientist needs to have to be successful in their job.
 
## HOW
We create 8 to 10 clusters around Clinical Data Sciences Topics.

Each cluster will be moderated by SMEs and contains of:
* Short overview about topic (1-2 pages)
  * Collection of short exercises and tutorials related to topic
  * Exercises and tutorials will be catalogue with 
    * internal PHUSE deliverables from PHUSE events and WGs accompanied by external educational links in all materials (articles, books, videos, podcasts) 
    * Tutorials could be done using Jupyter notebooks in R or Python, which allow submission of codes inside a notebook without having R or Python installed on a machine
  * Cover hot industry topics in PHUSE blog
    * Eg. Book reviews, ...
    
Most of this already exists in PHUSE archives or working group deliveries such as in Educating for the Future:Data Engineering and Data Science work and Emergent Trends
